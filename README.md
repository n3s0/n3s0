<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Timothy Loftus (n3s0)</h1>

I'm here to lurk through and assist with open-source projects and work on designing my own tools.

üî≠  Probably troubleshooting a wireless network somewhere.

üå±  I‚Äôm currently learning Go and Flask

üìù  Currently reviewing IKEv1 and IKEv2.

üìù  To stay up to date with my journal [https://n3s0.tech](https://n3s0.tech)

## About Me

I'm a network administrator with 6+ years of experience working in enterprise environments. I also enjoy lurking through open-source software to help.

### Open-Source Bits

I haven't completely developed all of these just yet. But, here are some open-source projects that I'm working on.

subnetcalc : A command-line tool written in Go that is a simple subnet calculator. But, there's a little twist to it. I've added a few reference tables for subnetting, ethernet cable length, and soon there will be a reference for wireless channels and standards.

peer : This is currently just an idea. But, I've recently round myself needing to review peering information to determine why customers are offline. The idea here is to provide a broad spectrum of information related to a public IP address and its place on the Internet.

I've recently moved my software projects and my blog to GitHub. Mostly due to the community aspect that it provides. I enjoy building tools that will be beneficial towards my carreer and my life. Generally, that is the reason for writting software or jotting things down in my online journal. I love to filter everything I learn into one place so I have the information available to me wherever I go.

### Networking Projects

I enjoy designing networks in my spare time too. At some point I will be providing a list of those designs below. At some point I intend on having a bunch of cookie cutter designs to choose from that will suite multiple situations. Sometimes I also get pulled into interesting scenarios too. I will be writting those soon.
