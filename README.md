## About Me

I'm a network administrator with 6+ years of experience working in enterprise 
environments. I also enjoy lurking through open-source software to help.

### Ansible Playbooks

As I automate workflows I intend to update this with my most recent Ansible 
Playbooks. Some being used regularly. Some not so much. It's still good to have 
them regardless.

[Ubuntu Update Playbook](https://github.com/n3s0/ubuntu-update-playbook) : Super 
simple playbook I'm using to update my Ubuntu servers when I need to. Just add the
servers to the hosts file, confirm that you have their public SSH keys, and off you
go. Let it run. 

### Terraform Files

I like to make the barrier between initial deployment and system setup as
efficient as possible. So, sometimes I'll orchestrate servers and cloud
instances with Terraform. Listed are files I use to accomplish this. Most of
these will have generics and items that need to be configured in the main.tf
files.

[Basic Ubuntu Server Vultr](https://github.com/n3s0/tf-basic-ubuntu-server-vultr) : 
Ubuntu Server deployment using Vultr with minimal resources. I use this to
automate Ubuntu Server deployments for learning and testing software when the
requirements are minimal.

### Open-Source Bits

I haven't completely developed all of these just yet. But, here are some 
open-source projects that I'm working on.

[subnetcalc](https://github.com/n3s0/subnetcalc) : A command-line tool written 
in Go that is a simple subnet calculator. But, there's a little twist to it. 
I've added a few reference tables for subnetting, ethernet cable length, and 
soon there will be a reference for wireless channels and standards.

[randfile](https://github.com/n3s0/randfile) : A command-line tool written in Go
for picking a random file from a list of files in a directory. My primary use
case for this is random wallpaper selection for the Sway and i3 window managers.

[certchecker](https://github.com/n3s0/certchecker) : A command-line tool I wrote
in Go that provides basic certificate information about a website.

I've recently moved my software projects and my blog to GitHub. Mostly due to 
the community aspect that it provides. I enjoy building tools that will be 
beneficial towards my carreer and my life. Generally, that is the reason for 
writting software or jotting things down in my online journal. I love to filter 
everything I learn into one place so I have the information available to me 
wherever I go.

### Networking Projects

I enjoy designing networks in my spare time too. At some point I will be 
providing a list of those designs below. At some point I intend on having a bunch 
of cookie cutter designs to choose from that will suite multiple situations. 
Sometimes I also get pulled into interesting scenarios too. I will be writting 
those soon.
